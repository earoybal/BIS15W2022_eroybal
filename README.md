## Overview
This repository contains the work done by me for BIS15L. The templates for the labs and homework can be found at [datascibiol](https://github.com/jmledford3115/datascibiol). All code is written in RMarkdown and is used for the purpose of exploring and learning R and R Studio. The R code was written using R version 4.1.2 (Ghost Hippie).
